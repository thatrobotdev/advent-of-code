These are ny solutions for the Advent of Code programming challenges! Check out the challenge here: https://adventofcode.com/

## Solutions
### 2021

* Day 1: Sonar Sweep - [C++](2021/1/main.cpp)
* Day 2: Dive! - [Java](2021/2/src/Main.java)
* Day 3: Binary Diagnostic - [Python](2021/3/main.py)

### 2020

* Day 2: Password Philosophy - [Java](2020/src/_2020/day02/PasswordPhilosophy.java)

## Build infornation

### 2021

#### Tools
* C++ solutions were created in [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), and should work on any modern C++ compiler.
* Java solutions were created in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), and should work on any modern Java compiler.
* Python solutions were created in [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), and should work on any modern Python compiler.

### Required dependencies
For each day, there are two files that you will need to aquire:
* input.txt - the input for the day
* input-test.txt - the test input for the day (given in the problem description)

If you place these files in the root folder for the day (Ex: 1/input.txt, 1/input-test.txt 2/input.txt, 2/input-test.txt, etc.), then you should be able to run the solution.

### Included directories/files
* .idea/ - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) project files

#### C++ solutions
* main.cpp - main file for the solution
* CMakeLists.txt - describes the project's source files and targets

#### Java solutions
* src/ - source files for the solution
* src/Main.java - main file for the solution

#### Python solutions
* main.py - main file for the solution

### 2020
These solutions were created pretty quickly, so I can't provide much information for how to build these.
